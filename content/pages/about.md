Title: About

Jason is currently the only student studying Scientific Computation/Applied Mathematics at 
The University of Waterloo. He loves learning about physics, statistics and computing and
shared that knowledge with everyone else.

During his first year at university studing Mathimatical Physics he decided to pick up some
Python to prepare himself for a Computational Physics course. He had so much fun that decided
to change directions and go into the field of Scientific Computation where he can learn and 
develop his skills as a programmer and a mathematician.

For his second coop term Jason will be working as a Data Scientist Intern at [Sysomos](http://www.sysomos.com/) working on their social media monitoring platform.

He started this blog as a way to improve his writting and keep track of what he is learning on his own time.
