Title: About

Jason is currently the only student studying Scientific Computation/Applied 
Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. He loves learning about physics, 
statistics and computing and sharing that knowledge with everybody else.

During his first year at university studying Mathematical Physics, he decided to
pick up some Python to prepare himself for a computational physics course. 
He had so much fun that decided to change directions and go into the field of 
Scientific Computation where he can learn and develop his skills as a programmer
and a mathematician.

For his second coop term Jason will be working as a Data Scientist Intern at 
[Sysomos](http://www.sysomos.com/) working on their social media monitoring platform.

He started this blog as a way to improve his writing and keep track of what he 
has been learning. The current topic he is currently interested in involve 
a bit of numerical computation and lot of probability involving Markov chains
and Bandit algorithms with some Machine Learning and Data Science on the side.
